                <p>I’m Matthew Spall, I’ve been an undergraduate student at Boise State studying Writing Rhetoric and Technical Communication, minor in Applied Data Science, and User Experience Design certificate.</p>
                <p>My passion for communication started in high school, where debate sparked my interest in writing, designing arguments, and connecting with audiences creatively. Since then, I've been focused on helping people understand complex ideas through clear writing, thoughtful design, and accessible experiences.</p>
                <p>I have hands-on experience in UX and accessibility, including internships with Blue Cross of Idaho as a Customer/Digital Experience Intern and with the Boise State Writing Department as an Accessibility Consultant Intern. Through these roles and my coursework, I've built skills in user-centered communication, technical writing, and design tools such as Figma.</p>
                <p>I’m currently seeking internship opportunities where I can continue to grow as a communicator, designer, and advocate for accessible, user-friendly experiences. If you’d like to connect, I’d encourage you to contact me!</p>
