                                <p>The purpose of the recommendation report is to improve the understanding of voter outreach and voter contact through canvassing, and to highlight areas of improvement to better communicate and market to voters. The research and proposals were delivered to the management of the campaign on December 1st, 2024.</p>
                                <p>The research was conducted through the collection of qualitative data as taking notes of conversations with contacted voters when canvassing. The canvassing was done as part of the Patricia Nilsson for Ada County Highway District Commissioner campaign, characterized as a low information municipal election.</p>

The organization I was responding to with this document is ATG Access, a United Kingdom based company that manufactures bollards. The document's purpose is to provide design recommendations for a white paper discussing safety in urban design, specifically with street furniture. The document was created as a part of course work at Boise State with the goal of writing professionally in many different genres and was created on April 17, 2023.</p>

                            <p>This article demonstrates my ability to combine journalistic storytelling with accurate reporting. Through interviews, research, and analysis, I highlight the challenges faced by public school librarians in Idaho, particularly in the face of political pressures and censorship efforts. The piece reflects my strengths in interviewing, narrative structure, and issue framing, as well as my commitment to amplifying underrepresented voices and defending access to information in public education.</p>
